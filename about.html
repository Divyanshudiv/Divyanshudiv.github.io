                About Me
            </h5>
            <p class="Info" data-aos="fade-up">Greetings, I am Divyanshu Singh, a student at BITS Pilani's KK Birla Goa
                Campus, majoring in computer science. I made this site to satisfy Harvard's CS50x course requirements
                and to exercise my skills in minimalist and basic ui design. I've always had an insatiable curiosity for
                computer science, and I love learning about new languages and techniques. Creating this site has been a
                great way to demonstrate my talents and broaden my knowledge of web design and programming. Furthermore,
                I am always looking for new ways to challenge myself and increase my expertise in the field of computer
                science, and this project has given me invaluable experience that I can use in the future.
                I've learned a lot and became even more interested in programming thanks to Harvard's CS50x. The breadth
                of the material covered and the practical nature of the exercises in this course have provided me with a
                set of skills that can be applied in a wide range of contexts. CS50x's emphasis on group work has
                introduced me to a wide range of people who share my interest in the field, creating a space where I can
                discuss my views and hear those of my peers.  In addition to my interest in computer science, I find
                great enjoyment in playing games and watching football during my leisure time. One game that has
                particularly captivated me is Dark Souls 3, which I have played and completed more than three times.
                Among the numerous challenging bosses in the game, Slave Knight Gael and Champion Gundyr stand out as my
                personal favorites. </p>
